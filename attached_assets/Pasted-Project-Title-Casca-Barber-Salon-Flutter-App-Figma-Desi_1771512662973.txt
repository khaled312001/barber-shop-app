📌 Instructions for AI / Developer:

🧩 Requirements
1. All Pages & Screens

Download and implement every screen in the Figma design. Respect:

Layouts

Spacing

Typography

Colors

Icons & illustrations

Make sure responsive layouts adapt to different mobile sizes.

2. App Architecture

Use Clean Flutter Architecture, including:

MVC or MVVM structure

Provider or Bloc state management

Separation of UI, business logic, and services

3. Navigation

Implement routing with:

Named routes

Custom transitions where needed

Back stack handling

4. Features to Implement

Based on design screens (interpret and build logic):

✔ Authentication

✔ Service Details
✔ Booking / Scheduling system
✔ Calendar / Date picker
✔ Cart / Checkout flow
✔ Payment Integration placeholder

5. UI & UX Accuracy

Match padding, margin, fonts, icons, and colors as per the Figma file

Use the exact fonts from design (include Google Fonts if used)

Use custom widgets for reusable components (buttons, cards, forms, etc.)

6. Asset Handling

Export all assets from Figma (SVG, PNG)

Organize into assets/images, assets/icons, etc.

Reference them properly in pubspec.yaml

7. Code Quality

Well-structured code with comments

No hard-coded values (use constants & themes)

Modular: separate widgets, screens, services

Responsive layout (MediaQuery or similar)
